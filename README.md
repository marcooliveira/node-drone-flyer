# Node.js drone flyer

## Introduction

This is a pet project for creating a controller and monitor for flying a Parrot AR Drone 2.0. It is based on an old PS3 like gamepad controller, and allows me to have lots of fun!

## Usage

### Controller

- **start**: takeoff
- **select**: land
- **Left stick**: pitch control, allows you to move front, back and sideways.
- **Right stick**: yaw control, allows you to rotate clockwise/counter-clockwise, and also go up or down.
- **cross**: stop and hover in place.
- **direccional keys**: flip left, right, ahead and behind respectively.
- **triangle**: calibrate the magnetometer. Will cause the drone to yaw 360 degrees in place.

### Monitor
